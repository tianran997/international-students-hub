                <h2>OPT & CPT Guides</h2>
                <h3>What is OPT?</h3>
                <p><strong>Optional Practical Training (OPT)</strong> allows F-1 students to work off-campus in their field of study for up to 12 months (or up to 36 months for STEM majors with extension). You can apply for OPT before or after graduation, but you must receive approval from USCIS before starting work.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apply early—processing can take several months.</li>
                    <li>Work must be directly related to your major.</li>
                    <li>Most students use OPT after graduation, but pre-completion OPT is also possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What is CPT?</h3>
                <p><strong>Curricular Practical Training (CPT)</strong> allows F-1 students to participate in paid internships or work experiences that are part of their program of study. CPT must be authorized by your school before you start working.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CPT is usually for internships, co-ops, or practicum courses.</li>
                    <li>You must have completed at least one academic year before being eligible (with some exceptions).</li>
                    <li>Work must be directly related to your major and approved by your academic department.</li>
                </ul>
