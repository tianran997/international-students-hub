                            Here are some degrees you may consider:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong><a

                                        of Arts (A.A.)</a>:</strong> A general degree that allows you to transfer to a
                                four-year

                                        href="https://seattlecentral.edu/programs/college-transfer/transfer-degrees/associate-business">Associate

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Check Course Prerequisites:</strong> Some courses require you to complete others first.
                        Make
                        sure you meet these requirements before registering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balance Your Course Load:</strong> Don’t take too many difficult courses at once. A
                        balanced schedule helps you manage your time and stress better. I usually take 15 credits per
                        quarter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Online vs In-Person:</strong> Some courses are available online, which can be
                        more flexible. However, in-person classes may offer better interaction with instructors and
                        peers. As an international students, you must choose at least 12 credits per quarter and at
                        least 7 credits for in-person classes to maintain your status.</li>

                    <h3>Tips for Transfering to University of Washington</h3>
                    <p>If you’re considering transferring to the University of Washington (UW), here are some specific tips:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Check Transfer Requirements:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://admit.washington.edu/transfer/">UW Transfer Admissions</a> page to understand the specific requirements for transfer students. Make sure you meet the minimum GPA and course prerequisites.</li>

Make sure you complete the necessary courses at our college that will transfer to UW. You can use the <a href="https://admit.washington.edu/apply/transfer/equivalency-guide/seattle/">Transfer Course Equivalency Guide</a> to see how your courses will transfer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prepare Your Application:</strong> UW requires a personal statement as part of the application process.

                        <li><strong>Get Involved:</strong> UW values well-rounded students. Participate in extracurricular activities, volunteer work, or internships that align with your interests and career goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Visit UW Campus:</strong> If possible, visit the UW campus to get a feel for the environment and resources available to students. Attend transfer information sessions or campus tours to learn more about the university. It takes only one-stop light rail (from capitol hill station to University of Washington station) to get to UW from our college, super close!</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Keep an eye on <a href="https://admit.washington.edu/transfer/">application deadlines</a> and any updates from UW regarding the transfer process.

                    </ul>
                    <div class="tip">✅ Based on your intended major, you may need to submit a separate application to the department after applying to the general UW. There are three types of majors at UW: open, minimum requirements, and capacity-constrained. Some majors are more competitive and have limited space, so it’s a good idea to have a back-up plan in case your first-choice major is highly competitive.
                        You can find specific requirements for each major on <a href="https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/">UW's majors page</a>.</div>
