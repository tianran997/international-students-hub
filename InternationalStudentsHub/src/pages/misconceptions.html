                <h2>Common Cultural Misconceptions</h2>
                <article>
                    <h3>Classroom Participation</h3>
                    <p>In many Western educational systems, especially in the U.S., speaking up in class — whether to
                        ask questions, share opinions, or challenge ideas — is seen as a sign of engagement and critical
                        thinking. Professors often expect students to join discussions, even if their answers aren’t
                        perfect.</p>
                    <p>However, in cultures where respecting authority or maintaining harmony is emphasized, students
                        may be taught to listen quietly rather than speak out. As a result, international students might
                        be unfairly seen as “not interested” or “too shy,” when in fact they are just being respectful
                        in the way they’ve learned.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: It’s okay to start small — even asking a simple question shows you’re
                        paying attention.</div>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Time Perception</h3>
                    <p>“Time is money” is a common phrase in many Western cultures, reflecting how seriously punctuality
                        is taken. Being on time — or even early — is considered respectful and professional in school,
                        work, and social settings.</p>
                    <p>But in other cultures, time is viewed more fluidly. Arriving 10–15 minutes late might be
                        completely normal and not seen as rude at all. This can cause tension or confusion when
                        expectations aren’t clearly communicated.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: In the U.S., especially for classes or appointments, always try to be on
                        time or let someone know if you’ll be late.</div>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Personal Space</h3>
                    <p>The idea of personal space — how close people stand or sit to each other — can vary a lot across
                        cultures. In the U.S., people tend to keep a larger “bubble” around them, especially when
                        interacting with strangers or acquaintances. Standing too close might make someone feel
                        uncomfortable.</p>
                    <p>In many other cultures, especially in parts of Asia, Latin America, or the Middle East, standing
                        close or even lightly touching someone’s arm while speaking is a sign of warmth or friendliness.
                    </p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: Pay attention to body language — if someone steps back, it’s probably not
                        personal!</div>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Direct vs. Indirect Communication</h3>
                    <p>In the U.S., being direct and straightforward is often valued. People are expected to say what
                        they mean and mean what they say, even if it comes off as blunt.</p>
                    <p>However, in many cultures, especially in Asia or the Middle East, indirect communication is
                        preferred. People might use hints or non-verbal cues to convey their feelings or opinions, as
                        being too direct can be seen as rude or confrontational.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: If you’re unsure about someone’s meaning, it’s okay to ask for
                        clarification!</div>
                </article>

                    <h3>Group Work Dynamics</h3>
                    <p>In many Western educational settings, group work is common, and students are often expected to
                        contribute equally. However, in cultures where hierarchy is important, students might defer to
                        the opinions of those they see as more knowledgeable or experienced, which can lead to
                        misunderstandings about participation levels.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: If you’re in a group project, try to establish clear roles and expectations
                        from the start to ensure everyone feels comfortable contributing.</div>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Feedback and Criticism</h3>
                    <p>In the U.S., giving and receiving feedback is often seen as a way to improve and grow. Professors
                        might provide direct criticism on assignments or presentations, which can feel harsh to those
                        from cultures where criticism is less common or delivered more gently.</p>
                    <p>In some cultures, feedback is given in a more roundabout way to avoid hurting feelings, which can
                        lead to confusion if a student is used to more direct criticism.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: Try to view feedback as a tool for growth, not as a personal attack. If
                        you’re unsure about the intent, don’t hesitate to ask for clarification.</div>

                    <h3>Socializing and Friendships</h3>
                    <p>In many Western cultures, friendships often start with casual socializing, like going out for
                        coffee or attending parties. This can be confusing for students from cultures where friendships
                        are built more slowly, often starting with formal introductions and gradually moving to more
                        personal interactions.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: Don’t feel pressured to socialize in ways that don’t feel comfortable. It’s
                        okay to take your time getting to know people.</div>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                    <p>Understanding what constitutes plagiarism or cheating can vary widely. In the U.S., academic
                        integrity is taken very seriously, and even unintentional plagiarism can have severe
                        consequences. However, in some cultures, sharing work or ideas is seen as a collaborative effort
                        rather than an infringement on intellectual property.</p>
                    <div class="tip">👉 Tip: Always check your school’s policies on academic integrity and ask your
                        professors if you’re unsure about what’s allowed.</div>
