# International Students Hub 🌏

## Project Overview
**International Students Hub** is a support website created to help international students — especially at Seattle Central College — adapt to life and academics in the U.S. To help international students overcome cultural differences, access practical resources, and build a sense of belonging, the site covers cultural misconceptions, academic and transfer advice, visa and work information, life guides, campus resources, and real student stories.

## 💡 Purpose

International students often face unique challenges when adjusting to a new culture, education system, and daily life in the U.S. This website aims to:

- Centralize scattered resources
- Offer personal insights and survival tips
- Build a peer-to-peer support platform
- Provide guidance on topics like CPT/OPT, transfer, healthcare, and more

## 🧩 Key Features

  Explains common cultural misunderstandings such as classroom participation, time management, personal space, and communication styles to help students better understand and adapt to American culture.

- **Life Guide**  
  Offers practical advice on transportation, healthcare, shopping, and daily life to help newcomers settle in Seattle.

- **Academic & Transfer Resources**  
  Provides course selection tips, registration processes, and detailed guidance on transferring (especially to the University of Washington).

- **Visa & Work Information**  
  Covers F-1 visa regulations, OPT/CPT internship guidance, scholarship applications, and tips for maintaining legal status.

- **Campus Resources**  
  Recommends study spaces, student clubs, campus events, tech and printing services to help students make the most of campus life.

  Allows students to share their own cultural adaptation stories via a form, with dynamic display of submissions to foster community and connection.
